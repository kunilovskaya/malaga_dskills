	\begin{frame}{Make a presentation about one of your hobbies}
		
		Produce slides presenting your favourite pastime \\(maybe a book you read last). Try to use the following:
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item a title slide with two logos
			\item ToC and progress before each section
			\item columns
			\item pictures
			\item alerted text
			\item overlays and incremental material presentation
			\item list environments
			\item boxes
			\item navigation symbols (at least the slides counter)
			\item references
		\end{itemize}
		Do you think you have time to develop your own unique presentation style file that would make all your talks stand out?
