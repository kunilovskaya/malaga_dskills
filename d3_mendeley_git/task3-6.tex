\begin{enumerate}
	\item As explained \href{https://www.wlv.ac.uk/lib/media/departments/lis/skills/study-guides/LS136-Guide-to-Writing-an-Annotated-Bibliography.pdf}{here}, it is a list of publications with your comments and takeaways.
	
	If you are using Mendeley:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Link Mendeley account to your Overleaf account
		\item Get bibliographic descriptions of several items you plan to read and put them into a shared folder in Mendeley
		\item Create the project .bib from the folder contents
		\item (optional) Can you tweak Mendeley to make use of the field \verb|annote = {These are my take-aways},| which pulls your Notes for the item in Mendeley?
	\end{itemize}
	\item In the source code, which you are encouraged to share with m.kunilovskaya@wlv.ac.uk, use your own words to comment the usage of the packages in the preamble.
