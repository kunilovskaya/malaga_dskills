- TeX is a typesetting system which was designed by Donald Knuth and first released in 1978.
- The letters of the name are meant to represent the capital Greek letters *tau, epsilon, and chi*, Greek for 'art' and 'craft' (*tech*nology).
- The word LaTeX is an abbreviation of 'Lamport's TeX', named after Leslie Lamport. He added and described **a collection of macros** (1986) to the original TeX.
- pronounced as /'la:tEk/ or /'leItEk/
- It is also a pun with the English word *latex* (try it in image google search)
